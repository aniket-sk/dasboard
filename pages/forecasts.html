                <ul>
                    <li>Forecasting is a technique that uses historical data as inputs to make informed estimates that
                        are predictive in
                        determining the direction of future trends.</li>
                    <li>Businesses utilize forecasting to determine how to allocate their budgets or plan for
                        anticipated expenses for an
                        upcoming period of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>This is typically based on the projected demand for the goods and services offered.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <div class="title"><i class='bx bx-right-arrow'></i> How Forecasting Works?</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investors utilize forecasting to determine if events affecting a company, such as sales
                        expectations, will increase or
                        decrease the price of shares in that company. Forecasting also provides an important benchmark
                        for firms, which need a
                        long-term perspective of operations.</li>
                    <li>Stock analysts use forecasting to extrapolate how trends, such as GDP or unemployment, will
                        change in the coming
                        quarter or year.</li>
                    <li>The further out the forecast, the higher the chance that the estimate will be inaccurate.</li>
                    <li>Statisticians can utilize forecasting to analyze the potential impact of a change in business
                        operations. For
                        instance, data may be collected regarding the impact of customer satisfaction by changing
                        business hours or the
                        productivity of employees upon changing certain work conditions. Forecasting addresses a problem
                        or set of data.</li>
                    <li>Economists make assumptions regarding the situation being analyzed that must be established
                        before the variables of
                        the forecasting are determined. Based on the items determined, an appropriate data set is
                        selected and used in the
                        manipulation of information. The data is analyzed, and the forecast is determined.</li>
                    <li>Finally, a verification period occurs where the forecast is compared to the actual results to
                        establish a more
                        accurate model for forecasting in the future.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <div class="title"><i class='bx bx-right-arrow'></i> Forecasting Methods</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stock analysts use various forecasting methods to determine how a stock's price will move in the
                        future. They might
                        look at revenue and compare it to economic indicators.</li>
                    <li>Changes to financial or statistical data are observed to determine the relationship between
                        multiple variables. These
                        relationships may be based on the passage of time or the occurrence of specific events. For
                        example, a sales forecast
                        may be based upon a specific period (the passage of the next 12 months) or the occurrence of an
                        event (the purchase of a
                        competitor's business).</li>
                    <li>Qualitative forecasting models are useful in developing forecasts with a limited scope.</li>
                    <li>These models are highly reliant on expert opinions and are most beneficial in the short term.
                        Examples of qualitative
                        forecasting models include market research, polls, and surveys that apply the Delphi method.
                    </li>
                    <li>Quantitative methods of forecasting exclude expert opinions and utilize statistical data based
                        on quantitative
                        information. Quantitative forecasting models include time series methods, discounting, analysis
                        of leading or lagging
                        indicators, and econometric modelling.</li>
